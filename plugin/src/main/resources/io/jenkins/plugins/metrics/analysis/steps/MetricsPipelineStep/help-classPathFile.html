    In order to use Type resolution during the analysis, PMD has to have access to the classpath of the project.
    <p>
        In case of a <b>maven</b> build, a file containing the classpath can be generated with:
        <code>mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=cp.txt</code>
        Alternatively it is also possible include this in your pom.xml so it is generated as part of the build.
        See <a href="https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/usage.html">
        https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/usage.html</a> for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
        When using <b>gradle</b>, a file containing the classpath can be generated by adding
        <code>
            task removecp(type: Delete) {
                delete "cp.txt"
            }

            subprojects {
                task printcp {
                    new File(rootDir, "cp.txt").append(":" + sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath.join(':'))
                }
            }
        </code>
        to the end of your build.gradle and executing <code>gradlew removecp printcp</code>.
    </p>
